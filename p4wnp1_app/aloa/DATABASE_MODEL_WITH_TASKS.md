In the context of this project, it would make sense to create a `Task` instance for every significant function or group of functions that you run. Each of these tasks represents a discrete operation that you're performing on the network, such as network mapping, device enumeration, traffic sniffing, and so on. 

By creating a `Task` for each of these operations, you can keep track of what has been done, when it was done, what parameters were used, and what the results were. This information can be valuable for both debugging and record-keeping purposes. If an error occurs during the operation, you can store that error in the `Task` instance as well, which can help you diagnose and fix problems.

Here's an example:

```python
from .models import Task

def perform_network_mapping():
    try:
        result = create_network_map()  # This would be your function
        Task.objects.create(
            function_name='network_mapping', 
            parameters={'subnet': '192.168.1.1/24'}, 
            result=result
        )
    except Exception as e:
        Task.objects.create(
            function_name='network_mapping', 
            parameters={'subnet': '192.168.1.1/24'}, 
            error=str(e)
        )
```

In the code above, `create_network_map()` would be your own function that performs the network mapping operation. If this function completes successfully, a new `Task` instance is created with the function name, parameters, and result. If an error is raised during the execution of the function, a new `Task` instance is created with the function name, parameters, and error message.

This pattern could be applied to any significant function or group of functions in your project.
