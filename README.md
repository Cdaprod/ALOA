Django-P4wnP1 is a powerful network toolset built on top of Django and P4wnP1 A.L.O.A., offering a web-based interface for various network operations including device enumeration, traffic sniffing, active and passive scanning, and much more.

## Features

This application includes modules for:

- **Network Mapping**: Utilizes connectivity to create a layout or 'map' of the network it's connected to.
- **Device Enumeration**: Identifies and lists the devices present on a network.
- **Traffic Sniffing**: Monitors and analyzes data packets travelling across the network.
- **Active Scanning**: Conducts active scans on the network, revealing open ports, running services, and possible vulnerabilities.
- **Passive Scanning**: Observes network communications and activities without sending out any packets.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Conducts MitM attacks, potentially intercepting and altering communications between two parties within the network.
- **Command & Control**: Acts as a Command and Control server to control other compromised devices within the network.
- **Dynamic Payload Generation**: Creates unique payloads for each attack, making them less likely to be detected by antivirus software.
- **Lateral Movement Automation**: Automates the process of moving laterally across the network.
- **Custom Encryption**: Encrypts data before sending it, making it more difficult for defenders to understand what has been stolen.
- **Traffic Mimicry**: Disguises malicious traffic as benign.
- **Deception**: Creates deceptive scripts that feed false information to the defenders.
- **Machine Learning**: Improves red team tactics using AI models.
