"Python Module (File) Name","Custom Functions","Python Packages/Modules","Description Details"
"network_mapping.py","create_network_map(), visualize_network()","socket, scapy, networkx","Functions used to create and visualize a map of the network, identifying all connected devices."
"device_enumeration.py","enumerate_devices(), extract_device_details()","socket, scapy, os, nmap-python","Functions used to enumerate devices on the network, gathering detailed information such as IP addresses, open ports, and running services."
"traffic_sniffing.py","sniff_traffic(), analyze_packets()","scapy, pyshark","Functions used to monitor network traffic, capturing and analyzing packets for potential security vulnerabilities or sensitive data."
"active_scanning.py","perform_active_scan(), analyze_scan_results()","socket, scapy, nmap-python, masscan","Functions used to perform active network scans, identifying open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities."
"passive_scanning.py","perform_passive_scan(), log_network_activity()","scapy, pyshark","Functions used to monitor network traffic without active interaction, reducing the risk of detection while gathering information."
"mitm_attacks.py","setup_mitm(), intercept_traffic(), alter_traffic()","scapy, mitmproxy","Functions used to set up and perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, intercepting and potentially altering network communications."
"command_and_control.py","setup_c2(), send_command(), receive_data()","socket, paramiko","Functions used to establish a command and control server, enabling control of compromised devices within the network."
